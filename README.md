Currently this is a place where, mostly, I'm storing my Today I Learned.

To compile the Today I Learned is done by downloading the TeX file and then running `python3 textohtml.py` from command line.

I'm currently working on getting images to work. Possible dependencies include the following:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y asymptote
```
