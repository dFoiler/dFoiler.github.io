		<h3><a href="8.html">October 8th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned a nice argument that if all roots of a polynomial $P(x)\in\ZZ[x]$ have magnitude no more than $1,$ then they are all either $0$ or roots of unity.</p>

		<p>Today I learned that the commutator subgroup (subgroup generated by $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$) of $S_n$ is $A_n,$ for $n\ge3.$</p>
		<h3><a href="12.html">October 12th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned that the leading digits of Fibonacci numbers $F_n$ follow Benford's Law.</p>

		<h3><a href="17.html">October 17th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned a little bit about Eisenstein's criterion, in hopes of finding a polynomial for which Eisenstein's criterion fails for any transformation.</p>
		<h3><a href="18.html">October 18th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned how to generate an irreducible polynomial which can't be proven with the standard tricks behind Eisenstein's Criterion.</p>

		<p>Today I learned the correct context for the statement last week that if $P(x)\in\ZZ[x]$ only has roots which have magnitude less than or equal to $1,$ then all of those roots are roots of unity.</p>
		<h3><a href="22.html">October 22nd</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned that the trace pairing over finite fields gives all possible $\FF_q$-linear maps $\FF_{q^r}\to\FF_q,$ from \href{https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~sk1233/courses/finitefields-F13/intro.pdf}{here}.</p>
		<h3><a href="23.html">October 23rd</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned a reason that monogenic extensions are, in a sense, kind of rare.</p>
