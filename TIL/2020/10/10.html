$Today I learned the finale to the classification of $\widehat\QQ.$ Namely, that $\widehat\QQ\cong\AA_\QQ/\QQ.$ We begin by remarking that the identification between $\chi\in\widehat\QQ$ with adeles in $[0,1)\times\prod_p\ZZ_p$ was in fact unique. Indeed, $a_\infty$ was forced by $\chi(0),$ and each $a_p$ had its $\ZZ/p^\bullet\ZZ$ information uniquely read by each $\chi(1/p^\bullet).$ And in reverse, each $a_\infty\in[0,1)$ uniquely talks about $\chi(0),$ and the $a_p$ in this set cover all possible $\chi(1/p^\bullet)$ possibilities, information which extends to all of $\QQ$ roughly using our arguments from before.</p>
		<p>It more or less remains to show, then, that every adele $a\in\AA_\QQ$ is a rational adele away from an element of $[0,1)\times\prod_p\ZZ_p.$ The main trick is to start by dealing with the $p$-adic problems by looking at\[-\sum_p\{a_p\}_p.\]Because all but finitely many of the $a_p$ belong to $\ZZ_p,$ this is a finite sum. It follows that adding the rational (adele associated with this rational) to $a$ will give an adele which is always in $\ZZ_p.$ To force us into $[0,1),$ then, we consider\[-\floor{a_\infty-\sum_p\{a_p\}_p}-\sum_p\{a_p\}_p.\]Note that the new integer added here does not change the status of $a_p\in\ZZ_p,$ and as for $a_\infty,$ the floor is chosen so that we are left with $\{\bullet\}\in[0,1)$ for a mess $\bullet.$ This shows that, more or less, we may write\[\AA_\QQ/\QQ\cong\QQ+[0,1)\times\prod_p\ZZ_p.\]We formalize this slightly.</p>
		<p>To finish, we recall that our mapping $\Psi_\bullet:\AA_\QQ\to\widehat\QQ$ was a surjective (shown yesterday) homomorphism and has $\QQ$ in the kernel; we close by showing the kernel is $\QQ.$ Fix some adele in the kernel $a.$ Writing $a=q+a'$ with $q$ a rational adele and $a'\in[0,1)\times\prod_p\ZZ_p$ given by the above, we see\[\Psi_a=\Psi_q\Psi_{a'}=\Psi_{a'}.\]However, the uniqueness of our identification of characters $\widehat\QQ$ with $[0,1)\times\prod_p\ZZ_p$ implies that for $a$ (and thus $a'$) to be in the kernel, we must have $a'=0.$ In particular, $a=q$ was a rational adele all along, so $\QQ$ is precisely the kernel.</p>
		<p>It follows that\[\widehat\QQ\cong\AA_\QQ/\QQ,\]which is what we wanted.</p>
