$September <a href="../index.html">2020</a></h2>
		<h3><a href="8.html">September 8th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the definition of perfect fields, from <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/galoistheory/perfect.pdf">Keith Conrad</a>: $K$ is perfect if and only if all irreducible polynomials $K[x]$ are separable.</p>
		<h3><a href="9.html">September 9th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the definition of the different.</p>
		<h3><a href="10.html">September 10th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the definition of "uniformly continuous'' from one of Tom's riddles: show that any uniformly continuous function defined on a bounded domain is bounded.</p>
		<h3><a href="11.html">September 11th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned some facts about the different ideal $\diff I,$ where $I$ is a fractional ideal of $\mathcal O_K.$</p>
		<h3><a href="12.html">September 12th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned that $\FF_q$ is also a perfect field for prime-powers $q,$ continuing from the Conrad expository paper.</p>
		<h3><a href="13.html">September 13th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned that the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem can sometimes be used as a lemma (!) instead of just always a theorem, from one of Tom's riddles.</p>
		<h3><a href="14.html">September 14th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned a more geometric interpretation of the $A^*$ in the definition of the different ideal.</p>
		<h3><a href="15.html">September 15th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the definition and some examples of the functor of points, which I think is my prototypical example of a contravariant functor.</p>
		<h3><a href="16.html">September 16th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the definition of localization of a ring.</p>
		<h3><a href="17.html">September 17th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned a very natural proof of Lucas's Theorem: for $p$ prime and integers $m=\sum_km_kp^k$ and $n=\sum_kn_kp^k$ written in base $p,$ we have
\[\binom mn\equiv\prod_{k=0}^\infty\binom{m_k}{n_k}\pmod p.\]</p>
		<h3><a href="19.html">September 19th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the categorical definition of the direct sum/coproduct.</p>
		<h3><a href="18.html">September 18th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned an example a proof by universal properties, by proving that localization commutes with arbitrary direct sums.</p>
		<h3><a href="20.html">September 20th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned about fibered products, which are basically products that make diagrams commute.</p>
		<h3><a href="21.html">September 21st</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned some applications of the idea that prime-splitting can tell us useful information about Galois groups.</p>
		<h3><a href="22.html">September 22nd</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned about Yoneda's Lemma.</p>
		<h3><a href="23.html">September 23rd</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned that the relative different is kind of multiplicative in towers, which unsurprisingly follows roughly from the behavior of trace in towers, with some fudging around.</p>
		<h3><a href="24.html">September 24th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the definition of a filtered poset for the categorical colimit.</p>
		<h3><a href="25.html">September 25th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned a proof that the relative different perfectly encodes ramification information of an extension $L/K.$</p>
		<h3><a href="26.html">September 26th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the sequence construction for the inverse limit in $\texttt{Set}$, or $\texttt{Grp}$ or $\texttt{Rings}$ or $\texttt{Vec}_k$ for that matter.</p>
		<h3><a href="27.html">September 27th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned why the Solovay--Strassen (probable) primality test can give confidence of $\left(\frac12\right)^{\text{witnesses}}.$</p>
		<h3><a href="28.html">September 28th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the definition of ramification groups.</p>
		<h3><a href="29.html">September 29th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned a construction giving a construction for a witness to the Solovay-Strassen primality test, from <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/ugradnumthy/solovaystrassen.pdf">Keith Conrad</a>.</p>
		<h3><a href="30.html">September 30th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned a somewhat easy precursor to the classification of finite abelian groups; it wasn't even as hard as it felt it would be in my head.</p>
