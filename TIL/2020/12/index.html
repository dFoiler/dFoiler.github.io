		<h3><a href="2.html">December 2nd</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned that products commute with limits, categorically speaking.</p>
		<h3><a href="3.html">December 3rd</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned about Hall's Marriage Theorem.</p>
		<h3><a href="4.html">December 4th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned that in all nonarchimedean fields $K$ with absolute value $|\bullet|,$ all triangles are isosceles.</p>
		<h3><a href="5.html">December 5th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned that, for any prime $p,$ every quadratic extension of $\QQ_p$ is contained in some cyclotomic field (not dependent on the quadratic extension).</p>
		<h3><a href="6.html">December 6th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the matrix form of the fast Fourier transform.</p>
		<h3><a href="7.html">December 7th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned that all fields complete with respect to an archimedean valuation are either $\RR$ or $\CC.$</p>
		<h3><a href="8.html">December 8th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the definition of generalized eigenvectors, to move towards Jordan normal form sometime in my far future.</p>
		<h3><a href="9.html">December 9th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned a generalization of Hensel's lemma.</p>
		<h3><a href="10.html">December 10th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned a proof of Niven's theorem, the statement that the only $\theta$ for which $\theta$ and $\sin(\theta)$ are both rational give $\sin(\theta)\in\left\{0,\pm\frac12,\pm1\right\}.$</p>
		<h3><a href="11.html">December 11th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned a proof of the Jordan normal form, from \href{https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/10/12/the-jordan-normal-form-and-the-euclidean-algorithm/}{Terrence Tao}.</p>
		<h3><a href="12.html">December 12th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the definition of a Newton polygon.</p>
		<h3><a href="13.html">December 13th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned about Laplace integration.</p>
		<h3><a href="14.html">December 14th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned that, for $K$ the fraction field of $\mathcal O_K$ Dedekind, $\op{SL}_2(\mathcal O_K)$ acts transitively on $K\cup\{\infty\}$ as fractional linear transformations if and only if $K$ has class number 1, from \href{https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/gradnumthy/SL2classno.pdf}{Keith Conrad}.</p>
		<h3><a href="15.html">December 15th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned the proof to the more general statement that orbits of elements of the projective space $K\PP^1$ under $\op{SL}_n(\mathcal O_K)$ is equal to the class number of $K.$</p>
		<h3><a href="16.html">December 16th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned that completely splitting (for unramified primes) in an abelian extension is determined by $p\pmod N$ for some modulus $N.$</p>

		<p>Today I learned an application of the theory from yesterday.</p>
		<h3><a href="18.html">December 18th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned a proof for the fact that the area of a section of a parabola bounded by a line is $\frac43$ of the area of that section's midpoint triangle.</p>
		<h3><a href="19.html">December 19th</a></h3>
		<p>Today I learned an explicit expression for $L(1,\chi)$ with Gauss sums, which I think leads towards the quadratic class number formula and a somewhat elementary proof of Dirichlet's theorem.</p>
