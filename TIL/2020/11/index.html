<h3><a href="9.html">November 9th</a></h3>
<p>Today I learned that the outline for the proof that, in an extension of number fields $L/K,$ if for every unramified prime $\mf p$ we have that $f(\mf q/\mf p)$ is constant for all primes $\mf q$ over $\mf p,$ then $L/K$ is actually Galois. </p>

<p>Today I learned some perspectives on those $\arctan$ facts that pop every once in a while. </p>
<h3><a href="11.html">November 11th</a></h3>
<p>Today I learned the proof that splitting of $\mf p$ in a non-Galois extension $L/K$ is in bijection with cosets $H\sigma D_\mf P$ for some prime $\mf P$ over $\mf p$ in the Galois closure $M$ of $L/K,$ where $H$ is subgroup of $G=\op{Gal}(M/K)$ fixing $L,$ and $D_\mf P$ is the decomposition subgroup. </p>
